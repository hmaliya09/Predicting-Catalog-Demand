# Predicting Catalog Demand

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting catalog demand for a company by building a linear regression model. The goal is to help the business decide whether to send catalogs to 250 new customers by estimating the expected profit.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze customer data to identify patterns and trends.
- Build and validate a linear regression model using predictor variables:
  - **Customer Segment**  
  - **Average Number of Products Purchased**  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for catalog distribution.
- Calculate the expected profit, which was estimated to be **$21,987**.

## 📈 Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn)
- Alteryx (for model building and validation)
- Excel (for data visualization and preprocessing)

## 📚 Project Structure
.



## 🚀 Results
Based on the analysis and modeling:
- The adjusted R-squared value was **0.8366**, indicating strong model performance.
- Predictor variables with the most significance (p-value < 2.2e-16):
  - **Customer Segment**
  - **Average Number of Products Purchased**
- The final recommendation was to send the catalog, with an expected profit of **$21,987**.
